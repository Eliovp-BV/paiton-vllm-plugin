# The host tier is inclusive (it keeps a copy of what the GPU pool holds), so system memory adds capacity only when its
# tier holds clearly more than the GPU pool: auto picks system memory when the tier holds at least 1.25 x the pool's
# tokens, otherwise NVMe/SSD behind a staging tier that restores a whole 256K document (4.5 GiB, the embedding on the
# GPU where needed) or the largest that fits down to 2 GiB (4 GiB: documents up to ~220K tokens, 2 GiB: ~110K).
# Token capacities use the tier space a stored token takes and the bytes a restored token loads (~19 KB), per image
# (TIER_BYTES_BY_IMAGE_SUFFIX), so an image that stores less per token gets the larger capacities without other changes.
# Every stored key (one chunk of one KV group) takes a whole tier slot of ~14.36 MB, the size of a block across the
# cache's layers (a 4 GiB tier holds 299 slots), and a 4-bit prompt stores ~4.3 keys per 1,600 tokens (two attention
# chunks, two 800-token drafter chunks, the recurrent states at the retained boundaries): ~40 KB of tier per token
# (330 slots for 120,001 tokens on the 20261004 images; the transferred bytes, 31-33 KB, undercount the padded slots).
# A prompt that needs more slots than the tier holds evicts its own oldest keys while it is stored, its recurrent
# checkpoints first, and gets no tier hit. The disk tier lives under PAITON_CACHE_DIR/kv-disk (or --disk-cache-dir) on
# NVMe/SSD, at most 64 GiB or a quarter of the free space there (with what the folder already holds). The tier has no
# size limit while it runs (~40 KB per newly prefilled token: a 64 GiB cap holds ~1.7M new tokens; continuous prefill
# fills it in minutes, a coding session in hours), so a run can overshoot the cap: the next start removes an over-full
# folder of its configuration. A full disk is safe for the tier: a failed store is logged and skipped (atomic files).
